become children of God. We open the door of our hearts to Jesus Christ and invite him in forever.

<i>Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner who deserves to be punished. But I also know that you took my punishment when you died on a cross for my sins, and that you rose from the dead to give me eternal life. So here and now, Lord Jesus, I invite you into my heart. Help me live each day for you until I see you face to face. Thank you for the gift of eternal life.</i>
Amen.
