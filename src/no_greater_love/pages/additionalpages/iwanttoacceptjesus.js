            <p style={{textAlign:'justify'}}>All we must do to become children of God is to receive Jesus Christ. If Jesus knocks on the door of your heart but you do not open it, you have not received him. If you open it a little, you still have not received him. But if you open the door wide, and invite him in, then you have received him. This is how we
become children of God. We open the door of our hearts to Jesus Christ and invite him in forever.
 
</p>
<p>You can receive Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior by praying these words:</p>
<p>
Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner who deserves to be punished. But I also know that you took my punishment when you died on a cross for my sins, and that you rose from the dead to give me eternal life. So here and now, Lord Jesus, I invite you into my heart. Help me live each day for you until I see you face to face. Thank you for the gift of eternal life.
Amen.
